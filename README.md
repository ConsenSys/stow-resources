This repository acts as your gateway into all things Stow. Here, you can find libraries and components written in JavaScript that you can use to build your own Stow-powered applications.

If you have any questions about how the protocol works or how to get started, this repository also contains documentation to steer you in the right direction.

## What is Stow?

[Stow](https://stow-protocol.com/) is a decentralized protocol that facilitates the secure storage and sharing of sensitive data.

Want to take a deeper dive into what the Stow Protocol is and what it stands for? Check out our [whitepaper](/introducing-linnia.pdf) or our [homepage](https://stow-protocol.com/) for more context.

## Metadata

For every record, Stow Protocol stores Metadata. This Metadata is chosen by the provider or whoever upload the record. The Metadata is completly public and the Stow Server can be used to query the Metadata of the records in order to find specific data. In order to have the data more organized and easy to search we provide specifications on how to write Metadata for you records. Go [HERE](METADATA.md) to check the specs.
